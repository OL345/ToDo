# TODO
This app allows you to create Tasks. The Frontend is Angular and the backend is Nest.js. 

## Add To-Do Function
  - Adds a Task to the .JSON file with an Id

## Delete Function  
  - Removes a Task from the .JSON file
  - Still has issues:
    - Site does not refetch data after. Site needs to be refreshed
    - doesn`t set the ids back

## Edit
  - Edits the Title and Description of the Task
  - Is managed with a dialog rather than a separate subsite
  - Issues: 
    - Does not reload data; Site needs to be refreshed so changes are displayed

## Start Server
   - start Backend with npm start run on http://localhost:3000/
   - start Frontend with ng serve on http://localhost:4200/
